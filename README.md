Here is a very brief project for the Create with Code pathway Data Persistence project.
I was running into a lot of challenges because I was trying to use legacy text commands with the new Text Mesh Pro Input Field.
I messed up the GitHub repo for my first attempt by trying to revert to an earlier version, so I had to make this second attempt with the Unity Hub and then copy and paste the files into a new GitHub repo.

Overall, this "30 min" project was a HUGE pain, but I learned a TON from it.  Glad to be taking my new knowledge and moving on to the next mission, though.
